## About me

I'm an aspiring web developer studying a Master's in Cyber Security. I have a love of technology, reading - whether's getting stuck into my kindle or getting  into the many stories I come across on Medium. When I'm not watching a series or film, I enjoy seeing new art exhibitions 

## About this repository

In this e-portfolio, I aim to showcase my skills, knowledge, and reflections during my cyber security degree. As an aspiring cyber security professional, I have dedicated my time to learning and implementing various techniques that will be of use during and after my studies.

Within this repository, you will find a collection of exercises and reflective pieces and more.

Each project is carefully documented, providing detailed explanations of the methodologies used, the challenges encountered, and the solutions implemented. By examining these projects, you will gain insights into my problem-solving abilities, technical aptitude and creativity.
